Bike stuff
====================

Different stuff. Currently consists of one library â€” s11n.

s11n (unstable)
---------------------
C++ serialization library with Boost.Serialization-like interface with such improvements:
- Header-only. 2 files and less 1k lines of ubertemplatesgodkillskittens (per one serializer format)
- Serialization of objects, which code can't be changed (out of class serialization with few limitations)
- Decreased compiler error lines per one mistake (it's more useful to read 50 lines of errors than 100, yep?)

Other features:
- Non-default constructors support
- Serialization of inherited objects
- Serialization of shared objects
