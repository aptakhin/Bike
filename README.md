Bike stuff
====================

Different stuff. Currently consists of one library â€” s11n (serialization).

s11n (unstable)
---------------------
C++ serialization library with Boost.Serialization-like interface with such improvements:
- Header-only. 2 files and less 2k lines of ubertemplatesgodkillskittenscode per one serializer format. Add one file for STL support
- Serialization of objects, which code can't be changed (out of class serialization with few limitations)
- Decreased compiler error lines per one mistake (it's more useful to read 50 lines of C++ errors than 100, yes?)

Other features:
- Non-default constructors support
- Serialization of inherited objects
- Serialization of shared objects
- Support for optional data with default values
- C++03 compatible, C++11 ready

Has full-featured formats:
- XML
- Binary

And also lightweight for machine-independent encoding/decoding *Streamed Binary*.
