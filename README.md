Bike stuff
====================

Different stuff. Currently consists of one library â€” s11n.

s11n (unstable)
---------------------
C++ serialization library with Boost.Serialization-like interface with such improvements:
- Header-only. 2 files and less 1k lines of ubertemplatesgodkillkittens
- Decreased error lines (It's more useful to read 50 lines of errors than 100, yep?)
